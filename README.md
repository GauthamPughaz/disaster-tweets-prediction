## Disaster Tweets Prediction

This notebook uses **Plotly** to visualize the distribution of tweets with respect to their characteristics, and it uses some simple natural language cleaning techniques to purify the tweets. I combined the **tf-idf** word-based and **Google's Universal Sentence Encoder's** 512-dimension features as it improved the model's accuracy than being individually used. Finally, I used **h20.ai's AutoML** module to fit the transformed data and was able to achieve an **F1 score** of **82.413%** on the test data. If you find this kernel useful please **upvote** and share your valuable feedback.
